# Discussion Templates

This directory contains GitHub Discussion templates for the DeePMD-kit repository. These templates help guide users to provide comprehensive information when starting discussions, particularly emphasizing the importance of reproducible examples.

## Available Templates

### 1. General Question (`general-question.yml`)
For general questions about DeePMD-kit usage, features, or concepts. Use this when you have a straightforward question that doesn't require extensive troubleshooting.

### 2. Usage Help (`usage-help.yml`)
For detailed help with specific DeePMD-kit usage scenarios. **This template strongly emphasizes providing reproducible examples** to help community members provide effective assistance.

### 3. Ideas and Suggestions (`ideas-suggestions.yml`)
For proposing new features, improvements, or enhancements to DeePMD-kit. Includes sections for use cases, related work, and implementation thoughts.

### 4. Show and Tell (`show-and-tell.yml`)
For sharing projects, research, or achievements using DeePMD-kit. Encourages sharing reproducible information and lessons learned.

### 5. Potential Bug Discussion (`potential-bug.yml`)
For discussing behavior that might be a bug before creating a formal issue. **Emphasizes providing complete reproducible examples** to help confirm whether the behavior is indeed a bug.

## Key Features

All templates are designed to:
- **Encourage reproducible examples**: Each template emphasizes the importance of providing complete, minimal examples that others can reproduce
- Follow the repository's existing style and conventions
- Include appropriate labels for categorization
- Provide clear guidance on what information to include
- Help users structure their discussions effectively

## Usage

When users start a new discussion, they will be presented with these template options. The templates guide them to provide:

- Clear problem descriptions
- Version information
- Reproducible examples with:
  - Input files
  - Configuration files
  - Commands run
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Complete error messages

This addresses the issue mentioned in #4506 where "many discussions do not give reproduced examples."
