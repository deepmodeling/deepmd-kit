# About DeePMD-kit
DeePMD-kit is a package written in Python/C++, designed to minimize the effort required to build deep learning based model of interatomic potential energy and force field and to perform molecular dynamics (MD). This brings new hopes to addressing the accuracy-versus-efficiency dilemma in molecular simulations. Applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems. 

For more information, check the [documentation](https://deepmd.readthedocs.io/).

# Highlights in DeePMD-kit v2.0
* [Model compression](doc/freeze/compress.md). Accelerate the efficiency of model inference for 4-15 times.

## Deep Potential in a nutshell
The goal of Deep Potential is to employ deep learning techniques and realize an inter-atomic potential energy model that is general, accurate, computationally efficient and scalable. The key component is to respect the extensive and symmetry-invariant properties of a potential energy model by assigning a local reference frame and a local environment to each atom. Each environment contains a finite number of atoms, whose local coordinates are arranged in a symmetry preserving way. These local coordinates are then transformed, through a sub-network, to a so-called *atomic energy*. Summing up all the atomic energies gives the potential energy of the system.

The initial proof of concept is in the [Deep Potential][1] paper, which employed an approach that was devised to train the neural network model with the potential energy only. With typical *ab initio* molecular dynamics (AIMD) datasets this is insufficient to reproduce the trajectories. The Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics ([DeePMD][2]) model overcomes this limitation. In addition, the learning process in DeePMD improves significantly over the Deep Potential method thanks to the introduction of a flexible family of loss functions. The NN potential constructed in this way reproduces accurately the AIMD trajectories, both classical and quantum (path integral), in extended and finite systems, at a cost that scales linearly with system size and is always several orders of magnitude lower than that of equivalent AIMD simulations.

Although being highly efficient, the original Deep Potential model satisfies the extensive and symmetry-invariant properties of a potential energy model at the price of introducing discontinuities in the model. This has negligible influence on a trajectory from canonical sampling but might not be sufficient for calculations of dynamical and mechanical properties. These points motivated us to develop the Deep Potential-Smooth Edition ([DeepPot-SE][3]) model, which replaces the non-smooth local frame with a smooth and adaptive embedding network. DeepPot-SE shows great ability in modeling many kinds of systems that are of interests in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science.

In addition to building up potential energy models, DeePMD-kit can also be used to build up coarse-grained models. In these models, the quantity that we want to parameterize is the free energy, or the coarse-grained potential, of the coarse-grained particles. See the [DeePCG paper][4] for more details.

# Download and install

Please follow our [GitHub](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit) webpage to download the [latest released version](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/tree/master) and [development version](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/tree/devel).

DeePMD-kit offers multiple installation methods. It is recommend using easily methods like [offline packages](doc/install/easy-install.md#offline-packages), [conda](doc/install/easy-install.md#with-conda) and [docker](doc/install/easy-install.md#with-docker). 

One may manually install DeePMD-kit by following the instuctions on [installing the Python interface](doc/install/install-from-source.md#install-the-python-interface) and [installing the C++ interface](doc/install/install-from-source.md#install-the-c-interface). The C++ interface is necessary when using DeePMD-kit with LAMMPS, i-PI or GROMACS.
