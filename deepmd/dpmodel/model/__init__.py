"""The model that takes the coordinates, cell and atom types as input
and predicts some property. The models are automatically generated from
atomic models by the `deepmd.dpmodel.make_model` method.

The `make_model` method does the reduction, auto-differentiation
(dummy for dpmodels) and communication of the atomic properties
according to output variable definition
`deepmd.dpmodel.OutputVariableDef`.

All models should be inherited from :class:`deepmd.dpmodel.model.base_model.BaseModel`.
Models generated by `make_model` have already done it.
