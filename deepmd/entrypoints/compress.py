    The table is composed of fifth-order polynomial coefficients and is assembled from
    two sub-tables. The first table takes the step parameter as the domain's uniform step size,
    while the second table takes 10 * step as it's uniform step size. The range of the
    first table is automatically detected by the code, while the second table ranges
    from the first table's upper boundary(upper) to the extrapolate(parameter) * upper.

    ----------
    input : str
