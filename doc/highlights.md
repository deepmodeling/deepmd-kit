# Heighlights in DeePMD-kit v2.0
* [Model compression](getting-started.md#compress-a-model). Accelerate the efficiency of model inference for 4-15 times.
* [New descriptors](getting-started.md#write-the-input-script). Including [`se_e2_r`](train-se-e2-r.md) and [`se_e3`](train-se-e3.md).
* [Hybridization of descriptors](train-hybrid.md). Hybrid descriptor constructed from concatenation of several descriptors.
* Atom type embedding.
* Training and inference the dipole (vector) and polarizability (matrix).
* Split of training and validation dataset.
* Optimized training on GPUs.
