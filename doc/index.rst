==========================
DeePMD-kit's documentation
==========================

DeePMD-kit is a package written in Python/C++, designed to minimize the effort required to build deep learning-based models of interatomic potential energy and force field and to perform molecular dynamics (MD). This brings new hopes to addressing the accuracy-versus-efficiency dilemma in molecular simulations. Applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems.
