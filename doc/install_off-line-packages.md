#Install with Offline packages

Both CPU and GPU version offline packages are avaiable in [the Releases page](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/releases).
After your easy installation, DeePMD-kit (`dp`) and LAMMPS (`lmp`) will be available to execute. You can try `dp -h` and `lmp -h` to see the help. `mpirun` is also available considering you may want to run LAMMPS in parallel.
