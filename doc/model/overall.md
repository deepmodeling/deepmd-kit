# Overall

## Theory

A Deep Potential (DP) model, denoted by $\mathcal{M}$, can be generally represented as

```math
\boldsymbol y_i = \mathcal M (\boldsymbol x_i, \{\boldsymbol x_j\}_{j\in n(i)}; \boldsymbol \theta)
= \mathcal{F} \big( \mathcal{D} (\boldsymbol x_i, \{\boldsymbol x_j\}_{j\in n(i)}; \boldsymbol \theta_d) ; \boldsymbol \theta_f \big),
```

where $\boldsymbol{y}_i$ is the fitting properties, $\mathcal{F}$ is the fitting network, $\mathcal{D}$ is the descriptor.
$\boldsymbol{x} = (\boldsymbol r_i, \alpha_i)$, with $\boldsymbol r_i$ being the Cartesian coordinates and $\alpha_i$ being the chemical species, denotes the degrees of freedom of the atom $i$.

The indices of the neighboring atoms (i.e. atoms within a certain cutoff radius) of atom $i$ are given by the notation $n(i)$.
Note that the Cartesian coordinates can be either under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) or in vacuum (under the open boundary condition).
The network parameters are denoted by $\boldsymbol \theta = \{\boldsymbol \theta_d, \boldsymbol \theta_f\}$, where $\boldsymbol \theta_d$ and $\boldsymbol\theta_f$ yield the network parameters of the descriptor (if any) and those of the fitting network, respectively.
From the above equation, one may compute the global property of the system by

```math
    \boldsymbol y = \sum_{i=1}^N \boldsymbol y_i,
```

where $N$ is the number of atoms in a frame.
For example, if $y_i$ represents the potential energy contribution of atom $i$, then $y$ gives the total potential energy of the frame.[^1]

## Instructions

A model has two parts, a descriptor that maps atomic configuration to a set of symmetry invariant features, and a fitting net that takes descriptor as input and predicts the atomic contribution to the target physical property. It's defined in the {ref}`model <model>` section of the `input.json`, for example,

```json
    "model": {
        "type_map":	["O", "H"],
        "descriptor" :{
            "...": "..."
        },
        "fitting_net" : {
            "...": "..."
        }
    }
```

The two subsections, {ref}`descriptor <model/descriptor>` and {ref}`fitting_net <model/fitting_net>`, define the descriptor and the fitting net, respectively.

The {ref}`type_map <model/type_map>` is optional, which provides the element names (but not necessarily same as the actual name of the element) of the corresponding atom types. A water model, as in this example, has two kinds of atoms. The atom types are internally recorded as integers, e.g., `0` for oxygen and `1` for hydrogen here. A mapping from the atom type to their names is provided by {ref}`type_map <model/type_map>`.

DeePMD-kit implements the following descriptors:

1. [`se_e2_a`](train-se-e2-a.md): DeepPot-SE constructed from all information (both angular and radial) of atomic configurations. The embedding takes the distance between atoms as input.
2. [`se_e2_r`](train-se-e2-r.md): DeepPot-SE constructed from radial information of atomic configurations. The embedding takes the distance between atoms as input.
3. [`se_e3`](train-se-e3.md): DeepPot-SE constructed from all information (both angular and radial) of atomic configurations. The embedding takes angles between two neighboring atoms as input.
4. [`se_a_mask`](train-se-a-mask.md): DeepPot-SE constructed from all information (both angular and radial) of atomic configurations. The input frames in one system can have a varied number of atoms. Input particles are padded with virtual particles of the same length.
5. `loc_frame`: Defines a local frame at each atom and compute the descriptor as local coordinates under this frame.
6. [`hybrid`](train-hybrid.md): Concate a list of descriptors to form a new descriptor.

The fitting of the following physical properties is supported

1. [`ener`](train-energy.md): Fit the energy of the system. The force (derivative with atom positions) and the virial (derivative with the box tensor) can also be trained.
2. [`dipole`](train-fitting-tensor.md): The dipole moment.
3. [`polar`](train-fitting-tensor.md): The polarizability.
