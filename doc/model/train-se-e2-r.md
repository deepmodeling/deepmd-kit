# Descriptor `"se_e2_r"`

The notation of `se_e2_r` is short for the Deep Potential Smooth Edition (DeepPot-SE) constructed from the radial information of atomic configurations. The `e2` stands for the embedding with two-atom information.

## Theory

The descriptor, using either radial-only information, is given by

```math
    \mathcal{D}^i = \frac{1}{N_c} \sum_j (\mathcal{G}^i)_{jk},
```

where
$N_c$ is the expected maximum number of neighboring atoms, which is the same constant for all atoms over all frames.
A matrix with a dimension of $N_c$ will be padded if the number of neighboring atoms is less than $N_c$.

Each row of the embedding matrix $\mathcal{G}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{N_c \times M}$ consists of $M$ nodes from the output layer of an NN function $\mathcal{N}_ {g}$ of $s(r_{ij})$:

```math
    (\mathcal{G}^i)_j = \mathcal{N}_{e,2}(s(r_{ij})),
```

where $\boldsymbol{r}_ {ij}=\boldsymbol{r}_ j-\boldsymbol{r}_ i = (x_{ij}, y_{ij}, z_{ij})$ is the relative coordinate and $r_{ij}=\lVert \boldsymbol{r}_{ij} \lVert$ is its norm. The switching function $s(r)$ is defined as

```math
    s(r)=
    \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{r}, & r \lt r_s, \\
    \frac{1}{r} \big[ x^3 (-6 x^2 +15 x -10) +1 \big], & r_s \leq r \lt r_c, \\
    0, & r \geq r_c,
    \end{cases}
```

where $x=\frac{r - r_s}{ r_c - r_s}$ switches from 1 at $r_s$ to 0 at the cutoff radius $r_c$.
The switching function $s(r)$ is smooth in the sense that the second-order derivative is continuous.

In the above equations, the network parameters are not explicitly written.
$r_s$, $r_c$ and $M$ are hyperparameters provided by the user.
The DeepPot-SE is continuous up to the second-order derivative in its domain.[^1]

## Instructions

A complete training input script of this example can be found in the directory

```bash
$deepmd_source_dir/examples/water/se_e2_r/input.json
```

The training input script is very similar to that of [`se_e2_a`](train-se-e2-a.md). The only difference lies in the {ref}`descriptor <model/descriptor>` section

```json
	"descriptor": {
	    "type":		"se_e2_r",
	    "sel":		[46, 92],
	    "rcut_smth":	0.50,
	    "rcut":		6.00,
	    "neuron":		[5, 10, 20],
        "type_one_side": true,
	    "resnet_dt":	false,
	    "seed":		1,
	    "_comment": " that's all"
	},
```

The type of the descriptor is set by the key {ref}`type <model/descriptor/type>`.
