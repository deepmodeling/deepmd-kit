The notation of `se_e3` is short for the Deep Potential Smooth Edition (DeepPot-SE) constructed from all information (both angular and radial) of atomic configurations. The embedding takes bond angles between a central atom and its two neighboring atoms as input (denoted by `e3`).

## Theory

The three-body embedding DeepPot-SE descriptor incorporates bond-angle information, making the model more accurate. The descriptor $\mathcal{D}^i$ can be represented as

```math
    \mathcal{D}^i = \frac{1}{N_c^2}(\mathcal{R}^i(\mathcal{R}^i)^T):\mathcal{G}^i,
```

where
$N_c$ is the expected maximum number of neighboring atoms, which is the same constant for all atoms over all frames.
$\mathcal{R}^i$ is constructed as

```math
    (\mathcal{R}^i)_j =
    \{
    \begin{array}{cccc}
    s(r_{ij}) & \frac{s(r_{ij})x_{ij}}{r_{ij}} & \frac{s(r_{ij})y_{ij}}{r_{ij}} & \frac{s(r_{ij})z_{ij}}{r_{ij}}
    \end{array}
    \},
```

Currently, only the full information case of $\mathcal{R}^i$ is supported by the three-body embedding.
Each element of $\mathcal{G}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{N_c \times N_c \times M}$ comes from $M$ nodes from the output layer of an NN $\mathcal{N}_{e,3}$ function:

```math
    (\mathcal{G}^i)_{jk}=\mathcal{N}_{e,3}((\theta_i)_{jk}),
```

where $(\theta_i)_ {jk} = (\mathcal{R}^i)_ {j,\\{2,3,4\\}}\cdot (\mathcal{R}^i)_ {k,\\{2,3,4\\}}$ considers the angle form of two neighbours ($j$ and $k$).
The notation $:$ in the equation indicates the contraction between matrix $\mathcal{R}^i(\mathcal{R}^i)^T$ and the first two dimensions of tensor $\mathcal{G}^i$.[^1]

## Instructions

A complete training input script of this example can be found in the directory

```bash
$deepmd_source_dir/examples/water/se_e3/input.json
```

The training input script is very similar to that of [`se_e2_a`](train-se-e2-a.md). The only difference lies in the `descriptor <model/descriptor>` section

```json
	"descriptor": {
	    "type":		"se_e3",
	    "sel":		[40, 80],
	    "rcut_smth":	0.50,
	    "rcut":		6.00,
	    "neuron":		[2, 4, 8],
	    "resnet_dt":	false,
	    "seed":		1,
	    "_comment":		" that's all"
	},
```

The type of the descriptor is set by the key {ref}`type <model/descriptor/type>`.
