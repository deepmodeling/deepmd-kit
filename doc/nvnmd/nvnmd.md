# Introduction

NVNMD stands for non-von Neumann molecular dynamics.

This is the training code we used to generate the results in our paper entitled "Accurate and Efficient Molecular Dynamics based on Machine Learning and non von Neumann Architecture", which has been accepted by npj Computational Materials ([DOI: 10.1038/s41524-022-00773-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00773-z)).

Any user can follow two consecutive steps to run molecular dynamics (MD) on the proposed NVNMD computer, which has been released online: (i) to train a machine learning (ML) model that can decently reproduce the potential energy surface (PES); and (ii) to deploy the trained ML model on the proposed NVNMD computer, then run MD there to obtain the atomistic trajectories.

# Training

Our training procedure consists of not only continuous neural network (CNN) training but also quantized neural network (QNN) training which uses the results of CNN as inputs. It is performed on CPU or GPU by using the training codes we open-sourced online.

To train an ML model that can decently reproduce the PES, a training and testing data set should be prepared first. This can be done by using either the state-of-the-art active learning tools or the outdated (i.e., less efficient) brute-force density functional theory (DFT)-based ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) sampling.

If you just want to simply test the training function, you can use the example in the `$deepmd_source_dir/examples/nvnmd` directory. If you want to fully experience training and running MD functions, you can download the complete example from the [website](https://github.com/LiuGroupHNU/nvnmd-example).

Then, copy the data set to the working directory

```bash
mkdir -p $workspace
cd $workspace
mkdir -p data
cp -r $dataset data
```

where `$dataset` is the path to the data set and `$workspace` is the path to the working directory.

## Input script

Create and go to the training directory.


```bash
mkdir train
cd train
```

Then copy the input script `train_cnn.json` and `train_qnn.json` to the directory `train`

```bash
cp -r $deepmd_source_dir/examples/nvnmd/train/train_cnn.json train_cnn.json
cp -r $deepmd_source_dir/examples/nvnmd/train/train_qnn.json train_qnn.json
```

The structure of the input script is as follows

```json
{
    "nvnmd" : {},
    "learning_rate" : {},
    "loss" : {},
    "training": {}
}
```

### nvnmd

The "nvnmd" section is defined as

```json
{
    "version": 0,
    "net_size":128,
    "sel":[60, 60],
    "rcut":6.0,
    "rcut_smth":0.5,
    "type_map": ["Ge", "Te"]
}
```

where items are defined as:

| Item      | Mean                        | Optional Value                                |
| --------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| version | the version of network structure | 0 or 1 |
| net_size  | the size of nueral network  | 128                                     |
| sel       | the number of neighbors     | version 0: integer list of lengths 1 to 4 are acceptable; version 1: integer |
| rcut      | the cutoff radial           | (0, 8.0]                                      |
| rcut_smth | the smooth cutoff parameter | (0, 8.0]                                      |
| type_map | mapping atom type to the name (str) of the type | string list, optional |

Multiple versions of the nvnmd model correspond to different network structures. `nvnmd-v0` and `nvnmd-v1` differ in the following ways:
1. `nvnmd-v0` and `nvnmd-v1` use the `se_a` descriptor and `se_atten` descriptor, respectively
2. `nvnmd-v0` has 1 set of parameters for each element and supports up to 4 element types. `nvnmd-v1` shares 1 set of parameters for each element and supports up to 31 types.
3. `nvnmd-v0` distinguishes between neighboring atoms, so `sel` is a list of integers. `nvnmd-v1` does not distinguish between neighboring atoms, so `sel` is an integer.

### learning_rate

## Training

Training can be invoked by

```bash
# step1: train CNN
dp train-nvnmd train_cnn.json -s s1
# step2: train QNN
dp train-nvnmd train_qnn.json -s s2
```

After the training process, you will get two folders: `nvnmd_cnn` and `nvnmd_qnn`. The `nvnmd_cnn` contains the model after continuous neural network (CNN) training. The `nvnmd_qnn` contains the model after quantized neural network (QNN) training. The binary file `nvnmd_qnn/model.pb` is the model file that is used to perform NVNMD in the server [http://nvnmd.picp.vip].

You can also restart the CNN training from the checkpoint (`nvnmd_cnn/model.ckpt`) by

``` bash
dp train-nvnmd train_cnn.json -r nvnmd_cnn/model.ckpt -s s1
```


# Testing

The frozen model can be used in many ways. The most straightforward testing can be invoked by

```bash
mkdir test
dp test -m ./nvnmd_qnn/frozen_model.pb -s path/to/system -d ./test/detail -n 99999 -l test/output.log
```

where the frozen model file to import is given via the `-m` command line flag, the path to the testing data set is given via the `-s` command line flag, and the file containing details of energy, forces and virials accuracy is given via the `-d` command line flag, the amount of data for testing is given via the `-n` command line flag.

# Running MD in Bohrium

## Run job

We will use Utility to submit jobs, you can install it with the following command

```bash
pip install lbg
```

When using the Lebesgue Utility for the first time, you need to configure your account by

```bash
lbg config account
```

Enter your Bohrium account and the corresponding password.

Then you need prepare the configuration file `job.json`, the configuration file is as follows

```json
{
    "job_name": "test",
    "command": "/usr/bin/lmp_mpi < in.lmp;",
    "log_file": "OUTCAR",
    "machine_type": "c8_m32_cpu",

| job_name     | the name of computing job, which can be named freely                                                                       | a string       |
| command      | the command to be executed on the computing node                                                                           | a string       |
| log_file     | the log file that can be viewed at any time during the calculation process, which can be viewed on the Bohrium "Jobs" page | a string       |
| machine_type | the machine type used for the job                                                                                          | "c8_m32_cpu"   |

Notice：The task will use 8 CPU cores for computation, so do not repeatedly use the `mpirun` command, otherwise an error will be reported. All 0000 after "project_id" need to be replaced with your own project ID, which can be viewed on the "Projects" page. Also, the JSON file format requires that no commas be added after the last field within the {}, otherwise, there will be a syntax error.

In addition, it is necessary to prepare input script of the MD simulation, the ML model named `model.pb` obtained by QNN training and data files containing information required for running an MD simulation (e.g., `coord.lmp` containing initial atom coordinates).

In the input script, one needs to specify the pair style as follows

```lammps
pair_style nvnmd model.pb 6 2
pair_coeff * *
```

where `model.pb` is the path to model, `6` is the cutoff radius, `2` is the number of FPGA cards used with the maximum of 2.

After preparing the configuration file and the required files for calculation, using Lebesgue Utility to submit the job

```bash
lbg job submit -i job.json -p ./
```

where the configuration file for the job is given via the `-i` command line flag, the directory where the input files are located is given via the `-p` command line flag. Bohrium will package and upload the specified directory, and after decompressing it on the computing node, it will switch the working directory to that directory.

After the job is submitted successfully, the JOB ID and JOB GROUP ID will be output.

![bohrium submit](bohrium_submit.png#pic_center)

## Check job status

After successfully submitting the job, you can view the progress and related logs of the submitted jobs on the `Jobs` page.

![bohrium status](bohrium_status.png)

## Terminate and delete jobs

You can choose between `terminate` and `delete` operations.

- Terminate: To end running jobs/job groups in advance, save the generated result files, and the status of the terminated jobs will be changed to "completed".

- Delete: To end running jobs/job groups, the status of the jobs will be changed to "failed". Job result files will be deleted, and the jobs/job groups disappear from the list. The delete operation cannot be undone.

The Jobs page provides buttons to end jobs and job groups

![bohrium group](bohrium_group.png)

![bohrium job](bohrium_job.png)

You can also use the Lebesgue Utility tool to end jobs

```bash
lbg jobgroup terminate <JOB GROUP ID>
```

```bash
lbg job terminate <JOB ID>
```

```bash
lbg jobgroup rm <JOB GROUP ID>
```

```bash
lbg job rm <JOB ID>
```

## Download Results

After the calculation is completed, you can download the results on the `Jobs` page, or save them to the data disk.

![bohrium download](bohrium_download.png)

You can also download it using the commands of Lebesgue Utility

```bash
lbg job download <JOB ID>
```

or

```bash
lbg jobgroup download <JOB GROUP ID>
```
