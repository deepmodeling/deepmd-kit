Pretraining-and-finetuning is a widely used approach in other fields such as Computer Vision (CV) or Natural Language Processing (NLP)
to vastly reduce the training cost, while it's not trivial in potential models.
Compositions and configurations of data samples or even computational parameters in upstream software (such as VASP)
may be different between the pre-trained and target datasets, leading to energy shifts or other diversities of training data.

Recently the emerging of methods such as [DPA-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08236) has brought us to a new stage where we can
perform similar pretraining-finetuning approaches.
They can hopefully learn the common knowledge in the pre-trained dataset (especially the `force` information)
and thus reduce the computational cost in downstream training tasks.

## TensorFlow Implementation {{ tensorflow_icon }}

If you have a pre-trained model `pretrained.pb`
(here we support models using [`se_atten`](../model/train-se-atten.md) descriptor and [`ener`](../model/train-energy.md) fitting net)
on a large dataset (for example, [OC2M](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/main/DATASET.md) in
DPA-1 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08236)), a finetuning strategy can be performed by simply running:

```bash
$ dp train input.json --finetune pretrained.pb
```

The command above will change the energy bias in the last layer of the fitting net in `pretrained.pb`,
according to the training dataset in input.json.

:::{warning}
Note that in TensorFlow, model parameters including the `type_map` will be overwritten based on those in the pre-trained model.
Please ensure you are familiar with the configurations in the pre-trained model, especially `type_map`, before starting the fine-tuning process.
The elements in the training dataset must be contained in the pre-trained dataset.
:::

The finetune procedure will inherit the model structures in `pretrained.pb`,
and thus it will ignore the model parameters in `input.json`,
such as {ref}`descriptor <model/descriptor>`, {ref}`fitting_net <model/fitting_net>`,
{ref}`type_embedding <model/type_embedding>` and {ref}`type_map <model/type_map>`.
However, you can still set the `trainable` parameters in each part of `input.json` to control the training procedure.

To obtain a more simplified script, for example, you can change the {ref}`model <model>` part in `input.json` to perform finetuning:

```json
    "model": {
        "type_map":     ["O", "H"],
        "type_embedding": {"trainable":  true},
        "descriptor" :  {},
        "fitting_net" : {}
    }
```

## PyTorch Implementation {{ pytorch_icon }}

In PyTorch version, we have introduced an updated, more adaptable approach to fine-tuning. This methodology encompasses two primary variations:

### Single-task fine-tuning

#### Fine-tuning from a single-task pre-trained model

By saying "single-task pre-trained", we refer to a model pre-trained on one single dataset.
This fine-tuning method is similar to the fine-tune approach supported by TensorFlow.
It utilizes a single-task pre-trained model (`pretrained.pt`) and modifies the energy bias within its fitting net before continuing with training.
The command for this operation is:

```bash
$ dp --pt train input.json --finetune pretrained.pt
```

In this case, it is important to note that the fitting net weights, except the energy bias, will be automatically set to those in the pre-trained model. This default setting is consistent with the implementations in TensorFlow.
If you wish to conduct fine-tuning using a randomly initialized fitting net in this scenario, you can manually adjust the `--model-branch` parameter to "RANDOM":

```bash
$ dp --pt train input.json --finetune pretrained.pt --model-branch RANDOM
```

The model section in input.json **must be the same as that in the pretrained model**.
If you do not know the model params in the pretrained model, you can add `--use-pretrain-script` in the fine-tuning command:

```bash
$ dp --pt train input.json --finetune pretrained.pt --use-pretrain-script
```

The model section will be overwritten (except the `type_map` subsection) by that in the pretrained model and then the input.json can be simplified as follows:

```json
    "model": {
        "type_map":     ["O", "H"],
        "descriptor" :  {},
        "fitting_net" : {}
    }
```

#### Fine-tuning from a multi-task pre-trained model

Additionally, within the PyTorch implementation and leveraging the flexibility offered by the framework and the multi-task training process proposed in DPA2 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15492),
we also support more general multitask pre-trained models, which includes multiple datasets for pre-training. These pre-training datasets share a common descriptor while maintaining their individual fitting nets,
as detailed in the paper above.

For fine-tuning using this multitask pre-trained model (`multitask_pretrained.pt`),
one can select a specific branch (e.g., `CHOOSEN_BRANCH`) included in `multitask_pretrained.pt` for fine-tuning with the following command:

```bash
$ dp --pt train input.json --finetune multitask_pretrained.pt --model-branch CHOOSEN_BRANCH
```

:::{note}
One can check the available model branches in multi-task pre-trained model by refering to the documentation of the pre-trained model or by using the following command:

```bash
$ dp --pt show multitask_pretrained.pt model-branch
```

:::

This command will start fine-tuning based on the pre-trained model's descriptor and the selected branch's fitting net.
If --model-branch is not set or set to "RANDOM", a randomly initialized fitting net will be used.

### Multi-task fine-tuning

In typical scenarios, relying solely on single-task fine-tuning might gradually lead to the forgetting of information from the pre-trained datasets.
In more advanced scenarios, it is desirable for the model to explicitly retain information from the pre-trained data during fine-tuning to prevent forgetting,
which could be more beneficial for fine-tuning.

To achieve this, it is first necessary to clearly identify the datasets from which the pre-trained model originates and to download the corresponding datasets
that need to be retained for subsequent multitask fine-tuning.
Then, prepare a suitable input script for multitask fine-tuning `multi_input.json` as the following steps.

- Suppose the new dataset for fine-tuning is named `DOWNSTREAM_DATA`, and the datasets to be retained from multitask pre-trained model are `PRE_DATA1` and `PRE_DATA2`. One can:

1. Refer to the [`multi-task-training`](./multi-task-training-pt.md) document to prepare a multitask training script for two systems,
   ideally extracting parts (i.e. {ref}`model_dict <model/model_dict>`, {ref}`loss_dict <loss_dict>`, {ref}`data_dict <training/data_dict>` and {ref}`model_prob <training/model_prob>` parts) corresponding to `PRE_DATA1` and `PRE_DATA2` directly from the training script of the pre-trained model.
2. For `DOWNSTREAM_DATA`, select a desired branch to fine-tune from (e.g., `PRE_DATA1`), copy the configurations of `PRE_DATA1` as the configuration for `DOWNSTREAM_DATA` and insert the corresponding data path into the {ref}`data_dict <training/data_dict>`,
   thereby generating a three-system multitask training script.
3. In the {ref}`model_dict <model/model_dict>` for `DOWNSTREAM_DATA`, specify the branch from which `DOWNSTREAM_DATA` is to fine-tune using:
   `"finetune_head": "PRE_DATA1"`.

The complete `multi_input.json` should appear as follows ("..." means copied from input script of pre-trained model):

```json
  "model": {
    "shared_dict": {
      ...
    },
    "model_dict": {
      "PRE_DATA1": {
        "type_map": ...,
        "descriptor": ...,
        "fitting_net": ...
      },
      "PRE_DATA2": {
        "type_map": ...,
        "descriptor": ...,
        "fitting_net": ...
      },
      "DOWNSTREAM_DATA": {
        "finetune_head": "PRE_DATA1",
        "type_map": ...,
        "descriptor": ...,
        "fitting_net": ...
      },
    }
  },
  "learning_rate": ...,
  "loss_dict": {
      "PRE_DATA1": ...,
      "PRE_DATA2": ...,
      "DOWNSTREAM_DATA": ...
  },
  "training": {
    "model_prob": {
      "PRE_DATA1": 0.5,
      "PRE_DATA2": 0.5,
      "DOWNSTREAM_DATA": 1.0
    },
    "data_dict": {
      "PRE_DATA1": ...,
      "PRE_DATA2": ...,
      "DOWNSTREAM_DATA": {
        "training_data": "training_data_config_for_DOWNSTREAM_DATA",
        "validation_data": "validation_data_config_for_DOWNSTREAM_DATA"
      }
    },
    ...
  }
```

Subsequently, run the command:

```bash
dp --pt train multi_input.json --finetune multitask_pretrained.pt
```

This will initiate multitask fine-tuning, where for branches `PRE_DATA1` and `PRE_DATA2`,
it is akin to continuing training in `init-model` mode, whereas for `DOWNSTREAM_DATA`,
fine-tuning will be based on the fitting net from `PRE_DATA1`.
You can set `model_prob` for each dataset just the same as that in normal multitask training.
