# Model compatability

When the version of DeePMD-kit used to training model is different from the that of DeePMD-kit running MDs, one has the problem of model compatability.

DeePMD-kit guarantees that the codes with the same major and minor revisions are compatible. That is to say v0.12.5 is compatible to v0.12.0, but is not compatible to v0.11.0 nor v1.0.0.
