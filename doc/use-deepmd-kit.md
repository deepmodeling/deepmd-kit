# Use DeePMD-kit
In this text, we will call the deep neural network that is used to represent the interatomic interactions (Deep Potential) the **model**. The typical procedure of using DeePMD-kit is 

1. Prepare data
2. Train a model
3. Freeze the model
4. Test the model
5. Inference with the model

## Prepare data
One needs to provide the following information to train a model: the atom type, the simulation box, the atom coordinate, the atom force, system energy and virial. A snapshot of a system that contains these information is called a **frame**. We use the following convention of units:

Property| Unit
---	| :---:
Time	| ps
Length	| Å
Energy	| eV
Force	| eV/Å
Pressure| Bar

The frames of the system are stored in two formats. A raw file is a plain text file with each information item written in one file and one frame written on one line. The default files that provide box, coordinate, force, energy and virial are `box.raw`, `coord.raw`, `force.raw`, `energy.raw` and `virial.raw`, respectively. *We recommend you use these file names*. Here is an example of force.raw:
```bash
$ cat force.raw
-0.724  2.039 -0.951  0.841 -0.464  0.363
 6.737  1.554 -5.587 -2.803  0.062  2.222
-1.968 -0.163  1.020 -0.225 -0.789  0.343
```
This `force.raw` contains 3 frames with each frame having the forces of 2 atoms, thus it has 3 lines and 6 columns. Each line provides all the 3 force components of 2 atoms in 1 frame. The first three numbers are the 3 force components of the first atom, while the second three numbers are the 3 force components of the second atom. The coordinate file `coord.raw` is organized similarly. In `box.raw`, the 9 components of the box vectors should be provided on each line. In `virial.raw`, the 9 components of the virial tensor should be provided on each line. The number of lines of all raw files should be identical.

We assume that the atom types do not change in all frames. It is provided by `type.raw`, which has one line with the types of atoms written one by one. The atom types should be integers. For example the `type.raw` of a system that has 2 atoms with 0 and 1:
```bash
$ cat type.raw
0 1
```

The second format is the data sets of `numpy` binary data that are directly used by the training program. User can use the script `$deepmd_source_dir/data/raw/raw_to_set.sh` to convert the prepared raw files to data sets. For example, if we have a raw file that contains 6000 frames, 
```bash
$ ls 
box.raw  coord.raw  energy.raw  force.raw  type.raw  virial.raw
$ $deepmd_source_dir/data/raw/raw_to_set.sh 2000
nframe is 6000
nline per set is 2000
will make 3 sets
making set 0 ...
making set 1 ...
making set 2 ...
$ ls 
box.raw  coord.raw  energy.raw  force.raw  set.000  set.001  set.002  type.raw  virial.raw
```
It generates three sets `set.000`, `set.001` and `set.002`, with each set contains 2000 frames. The last set (`set.002`) is used as testing set, while the rest sets (`set.000` and `set.001`) are used as training sets. One do not need to take care of the binary data files in each of the `set.*` directories. The path containing `set.*` and `type.raw` is called a *system*. 

## Train a model

### Write the input script

The method of training is explained in our [DeePMD][2] and [DeepPot-SE][3] papers. With the source code we provide a small training dataset taken from 400 frames generated by NVT ab-initio water MD trajectory with 300 frames for training and 100 for testing. [An example training parameter file](./examples/water/train/water_se_a.json) is provided. One can try with the training by
```bash
$ cd $deepmd_source_dir/examples/water/train/
$ dp train water_se_a.json
```
where `water_se_a.json` is the `json` format parameter file that controls the training. It is also possible to use `yaml` format file with the same keys as json (see `water_se_a.yaml` example). You can use script `json2yaml.py` in `data/json/` dir to convert your json files to yaml. The components of the `water.json` contains four parts, `model`, `learning_rate`, `loss` and `training`.

The `model` section specify how the deep potential model is built. An example of the smooth-edition is provided as follows
```json
    "model": {
	"type_map":	["O", "H"],
	"descriptor" :{
	    "type":		"se_a",
	    "rcut_smth":	5.80,
	    "rcut":		6.00,
	    "sel":		[46, 92],
	    "neuron":		[25, 50, 100],
	    "axis_neuron":	16,
	    "resnet_dt":	false,
	    "seed":		1,
	    "_comment":		" that's all"
	},
	"fitting_net" : {
	    "neuron":		[240, 240, 240],
	    "resnet_dt":	true,	    
	    "seed":		1,
	    "_comment":		" that's all"
	},
	"_comment":	" that's all"
    }
```
The **`type_map`** is optional, which provide the element names (but not restricted to) for corresponding atom types.

The construction of the descriptor is given by option **`descriptor`**. The **`type`** of the descriptor is set to `"se_a"`, which means smooth-edition, angular infomation. The  **`rcut`** is the cut-off radius for neighbor searching, and the **`rcut_smth`** gives where the smoothing starts. **`sel`** gives the maximum possible number of neighbors in the cut-off radius. It is a list, the length of which is the same as the number of atom types in the system, and `sel[i]` denote the maximum possible number of neighbors with type `i`. The **`neuron`** specifies the size of the embedding net. From left to right the members denote the sizes of each hidden layers from input end to the output end, respectively. The **`axis_neuron`** specifies the size of submatrix of the embedding matrix, the axis matrix as explained in the [DeepPot-SE paper][3]. If the outer layer is of twice size as the inner layer, then the inner layer is copied and concatenated, then a [ResNet architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) is build between them. If the option **`resnet_dt`** is set `true`, then a timestep is used in the ResNet. **`seed`** gives the random seed that is used to generate random numbers when initializing the model parameters.

The construction of the fitting net is give by **`fitting_net`**. The key **`neuron`** specifies the size of the fitting net. If two neighboring layers are of the same size, then a [ResNet architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) is build between them. If the option **`resnet_dt`** is set `true`, then a timestep is used in the ResNet. **`seed`** gives the random seed that is used to generate random numbers when initializing the model parameters.

An example of the `learning_rate` is given as follows
```json
    "learning_rate" :{
	"type":		"exp",
	"start_lr":	0.005,
	"decay_steps":	5000,
	"decay_rate":	0.95,
	"_comment":	"that's all"
    }
```
The option **`start_lr`**, **`decay_rate`** and **`decay_steps`** specify how the learning rate changes. For example, the `t`th batch will be trained with learning rate:
```math
lr(t) = start_lr * decay_rate ^ ( t / decay_steps )
```

An example of the `loss` is 
```json
    "loss" : {
	"start_pref_e":	0.02,
	"limit_pref_e":	1,
	"start_pref_f":	1000,
	"limit_pref_f":	1,
	"start_pref_v":	0,
	"limit_pref_v":	0,
	"_comment":	" that's all"
    }
```
The options **`start_pref_e`**, **`limit_pref_e`**, **`start_pref_f`**, **`limit_pref_f`**, **`start_pref_v`** and **`limit_pref_v`** determine how the prefactors of energy error, force error and virial error changes in the loss function (see the appendix of the [DeePMD paper][2] for details). Taking the prefactor of force error for example, the prefactor at batch `t` is
```math
w_f(t) = start_pref_f * ( lr(t) / start_lr ) + limit_pref_f * ( 1 - lr(t) / start_lr )
```
Since we do not have virial data, the virial prefactors `start_pref_v` and `limit_pref_v` are set to 0.

An example of `training` is
```json
    "training" : {
	"systems":	["../data1/", "../data2/"],
	"set_prefix":	"set",    
	"stop_batch":	1000000,
	"_comment": " batch_size can be supplied with, e.g. 1, or auto (string) or [10, 20]",
	"batch_size":	1,

	"seed":		1,

	"_comment": " display and restart",
	"_comment": " frequencies counted in batch",
	"disp_file":	"lcurve.out",
	"disp_freq":	100,
	"_comment": " numb_test can be supplied with, e.g. 1, or XX% (string) or [10, 20]",
	"numb_test":	10,
	"save_freq":	1000,
	"save_ckpt":	"model.ckpt",

	"disp_training":true,
	"time_training":true,
	"profiling":	false,
	"profiling_file":"timeline.json",
	"_comment":	"that's all"
    }
```
The option **`systems`** provide location of the systems (path to `set.*` and `type.raw`). It is a vector, thus DeePMD-kit allows you to provide multiple systems. DeePMD-kit will train the model with the systems in the vector one by one in a cyclic manner. **It is warned that the example water data (in folder `examples/data/water`) is of very limited amount, is provided only for testing purpose, and should not be used to train a productive model.**

The option **`batch_size`** specifies the number of frames in each batch. It can be set to `"auto"` to enable a automatic batch size or it can be input as a list setting batch size individually for each system.
The option **`stop_batch`** specifies the total number of batches will be used in the training.

The option **`numb_test`** specifies the number of tests that will be used for each system. If it is an integer each system will be tested with the same number of tests. It can be set to percentage `"XX%"` to use XX% of frames of each system for its testing or it can be input as a list setting numer of tests individually for each system (the order should correspond to ordering of the systems key in json).

### Training

The training can be invoked by
```bash
$ dp train water_se_a.json
```

During the training, the error of the model is tested every **`disp_freq`** batches with **`numb_test`** frames from the last set in the **`systems`** directory on the fly, and the results are output to **`disp_file`**. A typical `disp_file` looks like
```bash
# batch      l2_tst    l2_trn    l2_e_tst  l2_e_trn    l2_f_tst  l2_f_trn         lr
      0    2.67e+01  2.57e+01    2.21e-01  2.22e-01    8.44e-01  8.12e-01    1.0e-03
    100    6.14e+00  5.40e+00    3.01e-01  2.99e-01    1.93e-01  1.70e-01    1.0e-03
    200    5.02e+00  4.49e+00    1.53e-01  1.53e-01    1.58e-01  1.42e-01    1.0e-03
    300    4.36e+00  3.71e+00    7.32e-02  7.27e-02    1.38e-01  1.17e-01    1.0e-03
    400    4.04e+00  3.29e+00    3.16e-02  3.22e-02    1.28e-01  1.04e-01    1.0e-03
```
The first column displays the number of batches. The second and third columns display the loss function evaluated by `numb_test` frames randomly chosen from the test set and that evaluated by the current training batch, respectively. The fourth and fifth columns display the RMS energy error (normalized by number of atoms) evaluated by `numb_test` frames randomly chosen from the test set and that evaluated by the current training batch, respectively. The sixth and seventh columns display the RMS force error (component-wise) evaluated by `numb_test` frames randomly chosen from the test set and that evaluated by the current training batch, respectively. The last column displays the current learning rate.

Checkpoints will be written to files with prefix **`save_ckpt`** every **`save_freq`** batches. 

Several command line options can be passed to `dp train`, which can be checked with
```bash
$ dp train --help
```
An explanation will be provided
```
positional arguments:
  INPUT                 the input json database

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --init-model INIT_MODEL
                        Initialize a model by the provided checkpoint
  --restart RESTART     Restart the training from the provided checkpoint
```
The keys `intra_op_parallelism_threads` and `inter_op_parallelism_threads` are Tensorflow configurations for multithreading, which are explained [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide#optimizing_for_cpu). Skipping `-t` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS` leads to the default setting of these keys in the Tensorflow.

**`--init-model model.ckpt`**, for example, initializes the model training with an existing model that is stored in the checkpoint `model.ckpt`, the network architectures should match.

**`--restart model.ckpt`**, continues the training from the checkpoint `model.ckpt`.

On some resources limited machines, one may want to control the number of threads used by DeePMD-kit. This is achieved by three environmental variables: `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, `TF_INTRA_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS` and `TF_INTER_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS`. `OMP_NUM_THREADS` controls the multithreading of DeePMD-kit implemented operations. `TF_INTRA_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS` and `TF_INTER_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS` controls `intra_op_parallelism_threads` and `inter_op_parallelism_threads`, which are  Tensorflow configurations for multithreading. An explanation is found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41233635/meaning-of-inter-op-parallelism-threads-and-intra-op-parallelism-threads).

For example if you wish to use 3 cores of 2 CPUs on one node, you may set the environmental variables and run DeePMD-kit as follows:
```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
export TF_INTRA_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS=3
export TF_INTER_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS=2
dp train input.json
```

## Freeze a model

The trained neural network is extracted from a checkpoint and dumped into a database. This process is called "freezing" a model. The idea and part of our code are from [Morgan](https://blog.metaflow.fr/tensorflow-how-to-freeze-a-model-and-serve-it-with-a-python-api-d4f3596b3adc). To freeze a model, typically one does
```bash
$ dp freeze -o graph.pb
```
in the folder where the model is trained. The output database is called `graph.pb`.


## Test a model

The frozen model can be used in many ways. The most straightforward test can be performed using `dp test`. A typical usage of `dp test` is 
```bash
dp test -m graph.pb -s /path/to/system -n 30
```
where `-m` gives the tested model, `-s` the path to the tested system and `-n` the number of tested frames. Several other command line options can be passed to `dp test`, which can be checked with
```bash
$ dp test --help
```
An explanation will be provided
```
usage: dp test [-h] [-m MODEL] [-s SYSTEM] [-S SET_PREFIX] [-n NUMB_TEST]
               [-r RAND_SEED] [--shuffle-test] [-d DETAIL_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Frozen model file to import
  -s SYSTEM, --system SYSTEM
                        The system dir
  -S SET_PREFIX, --set-prefix SET_PREFIX
                        The set prefix
  -n NUMB_TEST, --numb-test NUMB_TEST
                        The number of data for test
  -r RAND_SEED, --rand-seed RAND_SEED
                        The random seed
  --shuffle-test        Shuffle test data
  -d DETAIL_FILE, --detail-file DETAIL_FILE
                        The file containing details of energy force and virial
                        accuracy
```

## Model inference 
One may use the python interface of DeePMD-kit for model inference, an example is given as follows
```python
import deepmd.DeepPot as DP
import numpy as np
dp = DP('graph.pb')
coord = np.array([[1,0,0], [0,0,1.5], [1,0,3]]).reshape([1, -1])
cell = np.diag(10 * np.ones(3)).reshape([1, -1])
atype = [1,0,1]
e, f, v = dp.eval(coord, cell, atype)
```
where `e`, `f` and `v` are predicted energy, force and virial of the system, respectively.


## Run MD with LAMMPS
### Include deepmd in the pair style
Running an MD simulation with LAMMPS is simpler. In the LAMMPS input file, one needs to specify the pair style as follows
```bash
pair_style     deepmd graph.pb
pair_coeff     
```
where `graph.pb` is the file name of the frozen model. The `pair_coeff` should be left blank. It should be noted that LAMMPS counts atom types starting from 1, therefore, all LAMMPS atom type will be firstly subtracted by 1, and then passed into the DeePMD-kit engine to compute the interactions. [A detailed documentation of this pair style is available.](doc/lammps-pair-style-deepmd.md).

### Long-range interaction
The reciprocal space part of the long-range interaction can be calculated by LAMMPS command `kspace_style`. To use it with DeePMD-kit, one writes 
```bash
pair_style	deepmd graph.pb
pair_coeff
kspace_style	pppm 1.0e-5
kspace_modify	gewald 0.45
```
Please notice that the DeePMD does nothing to the direct space part of the electrostatic interaction, because this part is assumed to be fitted in the DeePMD model (the direct space cut-off is thus the cut-off of the DeePMD model). The splitting parameter `gewald` is modified by the `kspace_modify` command.

## Run path-integral MD with i-PI
The i-PI works in a client-server model. The i-PI provides the server for integrating the replica positions of atoms, while the DeePMD-kit provides a client named `dp_ipi` that computes the interactions (including energy, force and virial). The server and client communicates via the Unix domain socket or the Internet socket. The client can be started by
```bash
$ dp_ipi water.json
```
It is noted that multiple instances of the client is allow for computing, in parallel, the interactions of multiple replica of the path-integral MD.

`water.json` is the parameter file for the client `dp_ipi`, and [an example](./examples/ipi/water.json) is provided:
```json
{
    "verbose":		false,
    "use_unix":		true,
    "port":		31415,
    "host":		"localhost",
    "graph_file":	"graph.pb",
    "coord_file":	"conf.xyz",
    "atom_type" : {
	"OW":		0, 
	"HW1":		1,
	"HW2":		1
    }
}
```
The option **`use_unix`** is set to `true` to activate the Unix domain socket, otherwise, the Internet socket is used.

The option **`graph_file`** provides the file name of the frozen model.

The `dp_ipi` gets the atom names from an [XYZ file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format) provided by **`coord_file`** (meanwhile ignores all coordinates in it), and translates the names to atom types by rules provided by **`atom_type`**.

## Use deep potential with ASE

Deep potential can be set up as a calculator with ASE to obtain potential energies and forces.
```python
from ase import Atoms
from deepmd.calculator import DP

water = Atoms('H2O',
              positions=[(0.7601, 1.9270, 1),
                         (1.9575, 1, 1),
                         (1., 1., 1.)],
              cell=[100, 100, 100],
              calculator=DP(model="frozen_model.pb"))
print(water.get_potential_energy())
print(water.get_forces())
```

Optimization is also available:
```python
from ase.optimize import BFGS
dyn = BFGS(water)
dyn.run(fmax=1e-6)
print(water.get_positions())
```
