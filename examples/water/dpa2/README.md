## Inputs for DPA-2 model

This directory contains the input files for training the DPA-2 model (currently supporting PyTorch backend only). Depending on your precision/efficiency requirements, we provide three different levels of model complexity:

- `input_torch_small.json`: Our smallest DPA-2 model, optimized for speed.
- `input_torch_medium.json` (Recommended): Our well-performing DPA-2 model, balancing efficiency and precision. This is a good starting point for most users.
- `input_torch_large.json`: Our most complex model with the highest precision, suitable for very intricate data structures.

For detailed differences in their configurations, please refer to the table below:
