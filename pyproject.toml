# selectively turn of lintner warnings, always include reasoning why any warning should

# W504 - line break after binary operator - there is conflict between W503 and W504 in
# some lintners. One recomends line bread after and one before binary operator so we
# swith W504 off and recomend this coding style:
# a = (b +     -> instead of -> a = (b

# D413 - Missing blank line after last section - makes no sense only adds empy lines in

# D416 - Section name should end with a colon - only applicable to RST type docstrings,
# we are using numpy style
# D203 - 1 blank line required before class docstring - only adds unnecessary empty space
# D107 - Missing docstring in __init__ - Nupmy style documents __init__ parameters in
# class docstring
# D213 - Multi-line docstring summary should start at the second line - unnecessary waste
# of space, start on the first line
